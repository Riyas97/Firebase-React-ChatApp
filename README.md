# Chat App using Firebase and React

## Introduction
This is a chat application that everybody can use to communicate using text messages in a single channel. To enter the chat, users must first log in using their Google account. Once logged in, users can read previous messages and start sending messages as can be seen below.

All messages are stored in a Firestore database and are sync in real-time with our React application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
